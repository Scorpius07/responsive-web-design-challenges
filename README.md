*This Repo consists of all different courses I completed in [the certification web-dev course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). 
I've not included "Cat Photo App" as I think that's merely beginner-material.*

# Projects given in Responsive Web Design:

Projects assigned in the Responsive Web Design are provided 
[in my repositories](https://github.com/Scorpius07?tab=repositories), along with how I did them. 
Note that they are available as individual repositories
